Sleebit
=================
Sleebit is an alarm app oriented by sleep cycles.

Introduction
------------
A cycle of sleep is a collection of stages that start when a person falls asleep; they'll evolve becoming deeper every time until the body reaches the REM (Rapid Eye Movement) stage.
Usually, the REM stage is the hardest to get in but it is in this stage that the body will rest better and the brain renewal rate is bigger.
An adult needs to sleep between four to five cycles every night, which is almost the eight hours well known recommended.

The goal of this app is to be an alarm where one must select how many cycles one wants to sleep and the app will trigger a notification by the time that one should go to sleep.
